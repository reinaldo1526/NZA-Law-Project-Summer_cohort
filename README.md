# NZA LAW GROUP PROJECT - CODING TEMPLE

In this project, you will be tasked with creating a new website for a “law firm”. This website’s mock design is also included in this file. This will be a group project in which each person should share an equal role in the finished product. The project starter files have been created and can be found here -- https://github.com/CodingTemple/NZA-Law-Project-Summer_cohort.git

One person from the group (Original Team Member) will need to Fork the github starter files to their Github Profile. From there each person will need to clone and work on their portion of the product. When each of you have completed your parts of the project, commit them back to github and submit a pull request to the original team member’s repository. Each person will then need to submit the original team member’s github link to google classroom.

**TASK:** 
    - Create Website using CSS3.
**Challenge** Create a responsive design using Bootstrap or CSS Grid

**IMPORTANT NOTE** : The project is not considered complete until it has been checked in (uploaded) to your GitHub account and the original team member's link posted to the Google Classroom assignment(each person individually).
